- fix issues with terminal priority when the different parses are
coming from different states.... what does this mean?
- fix ambiguity handling for parsing from start states... need to force a final reduction
  either bloat the state table (probably best), or try to force the reduction manually....
- add trailing context to regular expressions
- enhance cmp_stacks
- optimize speed
? LALR
? error repair a la Carl Cerecke
? split global state on demand
? ensure that states only summarize identical .scope, .globals and .skip_space
? eager parser

handle path for include files
add option to name the output file.

fix issue with equiv_D_Scope.
